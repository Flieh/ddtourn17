            <h1 class="c4 c11"><span>Diplomacy Rules:</span></h1>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Rules: </span><span class="c5">The tournament will abide by all rules used by the Droidippy app.</span></p>
            <h1 class="c4 c11"><span>Tournament Play:</span></h1>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Ranking:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;All players will be seeded with a rank of 1 through n (n being the number of players). Due to the fact that players are not ranked these seeds will be generated randomly.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Stages: </span><span class="c5">The tournament will consist of two stages. The first stage will be a round robin format. After the round robin, the seven players with the highest overall scores will face off in a final stage.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Round Robin:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Players will be assigned to games based upon their randomly assigned seeds. Players 1 through 7 will play in game one, and the rest of the games will be filled similarly. Efforts will be made to ensure that players play as many different players as possible. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5">All players shall play a minimum of 4 rounds, with the majority playing 5. The number of people who will play 4 rounds depends on the number of players who sign up for the tournament. Having a number of players that is not a multiple of 7 means that not everyone will be able to play the same number of games. As a result some players will have to play 4 rounds instead of 5. To make this as fair as possible, the last people to sign up for the tournament will play the four games. For example, if there are 50 players (one above a multiple of 7) 5 players will have to play 4 games to properly create a schedule. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5">Note: The way that this will be taken into account with regards to scoring can be seen in the tournament scoring section of the rules.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Final: </span><span class="c5">The players with the top seven scores throughout the round robin will be selected to play in a final match. At the end of the final match, players&rsquo; scores will be added to their round robin scores. At this point, the player with the highest overall score will be considered to be the tournament champion.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">NMR in the Final:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;In the event of a Spring &rsquo;01 NMR in the final game, the player ranked eighth in the round robin will be asked to play in the final. If the tournament director does not hear back from this player within 48 hours, the tournament director will take the seventh spot in the final match. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Game Scheduling:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Players will receive their schedule on a round by round basis as the tournament goes on. A full schedule will not be given at the start of the tournament. Only players&rsquo; first round match-ups. This is to allow for players dropping out and joining after the tournament has started. To allow players to focus on first year negotiations, games will start one week after each other. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Forming Games:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;The tournament director will ask one player from each game to form a game. When the game has been formed and the code sent to the tournament director, it will be distributed to all other players in that game. In the event that a game is setup incorrectly (wrong end date, preference list not random, etc.) Players should contact the tournament director and inform them of the issue.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Country Assignments: </span><span class="c5">Players will be assigned countries at random, using Droidippy&rsquo;s game generator. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Gameplay: </span><span class="c5">All games will be played with the standard Droidippy procedures. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Game Times: </span><span class="c5">Games will have 36 hour deadlines. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Game Scoring: </span><span class="c5">C-Diplo will be used to score this tournament. This is scored using the following.</span></p>
            <ul class="c2 lst-kix_list_3-0 start">
                <li class="c7 c4"><span class="c0">1 point each for playing (7)</span></li>
                <li class="c7 c4"><span class="c0">1 point for each supply center in your possession at the end of the game (34)</span></li>
                <li class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">38 points for topping the board (38)</span></li>
                <li class="c7 c4"><span class="c0">14 points for coming second (14)</span></li>
                <li class="c1"><span class="c0">7 points for coming third (7)</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5">A solo results in the winner obtaining 100 points and everybody else 0.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5">In the event of a tie the tied players shall share the points for the positions in which they were tied. For example, if two players come second, they will share the 14 points for second, and 7 points for third.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Game end: </span><span class="c5">Games will end when the first of the following occurs;</span></p>
            <ol class="c2 lst-kix_list_4-0 start" start="1">
                <li class="c7 c4"><span class="c0">One player reaches a solo</span></li>
                <li class="c7 c4"><span class="c0">A draw is agreed upon by all players</span></li>
                <li class="c1"><span class="c0">Year 1910 ends</span></li>
            </ol>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Reporting Game Completion:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;After a game has been completed, the winner of the game is asked to email the tournament director with the results.</span></p>
            <p class="c4" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c5 c6">Tournament Scoring: </span><span class="c5">To account for the variation in number of games played, only the best three scores of each player will be counted towards their overall tournament score.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Ties: </span><span class="c5">In the event of a tie in the tournament standings, the player with the most of the following will be considered the victor; </span></p>
            <ul class="c2 lst-kix_list_5-0 start">
                <li class="c7 c4"><span class="c0">Most Solos</span></li>
                <li class="c7 c4"><span class="c0">Most Second Place Finishes</span></li>
                <li class="c7 c4"><span class="c0">Most Third Place Finishes</span></li>
                <li class="c1"><span class="c0">Head to head (If the players played each other, the player with the better score shall be considered the victor.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Replacements: </span><span class="c5">If an issue arises whereby a player can no longer continue playing the game, or a country has been in civil disorder for one full year; the tournament director will assign a replacement player to finish the game.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Replacement Players: </span><span class="c5">The tournament director will attempt to find a player who is not participating in the tournament to fill empty countries. Failing this, the tournament director will finish the game as the empty country. If neither of these are possible, the tournament director will randomly choose a player in the tournament to fill the role. This player will not receive a score for the game in which they are a replacement. </span></p>
            <p class="c4 c10"><span class="c5">Note: Players do not have any obligation to participate as a replacement. If the randomly selected player does not wish to play, the tournament director will ask someone else.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Absent Players:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;If a player has become unresponsive during one of their games, the tournament director will make an effort to contact them to determine the issue. If the tournament director is unable to make contact, they will disqualify them, and assign replacement players to the absentee&rsquo;s games at the tournament director&rsquo;s discretion. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Reinstatement: </span><span class="c5">If an absent player responds to the tournament director after measures were taken to fill the player&rsquo;s games, the player may be reinstated. However, this will be solely at the tournament director&rsquo;s discretion. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Late joiners: </span><span class="c5">Should players request to join the tournament after the registration deadline, they may have the ability to participate at the tournament director&rsquo;s discretion. If they join before the end of the second round the tournament director may allow them to play the final three rounds and count these three scores. The tournament director may also keep these players as a spare if they join after the end of the second round, or if they deem it necessary for the good of the tournament. Should they be kept as spares, if they participate in three games as substitutions starting in the first year of play, their scores shall count as a full game. </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5">Note: If for any reason a player is unable to continue in the tournament, please contact the tournament director, so that they might be able to better schedule the rest of the tournament. </span></p>
            <h1 class="c4 c11"><span>Disputes and Misconduct:</span></h1>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Disputes: </span><span class="c5">In the event a dispute arises between players, they are invited to solve it amongst themselves. If unable to do so, the tournament director will make a decision regarding the dispute. Any decision rendered by the tournament director will be considered binding and will not be subject to appeal.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Misconduct:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Players are encouraged to conduct themselves in a proper manner, and any player who commits a misconduct will be penalized by the tournament director.

If it is a report of an issue such as racial slurs please attach screenshots of the comments to the email. As the tournament is being run on the Droidippy app, these issues may also be of concern to Chris. As a result feel free to copy him on the email, or send it to him first. If the tournament director is the only one to receive the email they will forward it on to Chris if they deem it necessary. </span></p>
            <p class="c4 c10"><span class="c5">Note: Droidippy is a game where people sometimes wish to act as if they are in the time period. This can result in period specific language that could be offensive. This will be taken into account when necessary. </span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5">Please note that the tournament director may rule on subjects not covered by the rules. They may decide to go against the rules if they determine that it would be for the overall good of the tournament. </span></p>
